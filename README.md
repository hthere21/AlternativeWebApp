## Project Overview
Welcome to Alternate Interaction December 2022, an innovative and immersive web experience that redefines the process of rating random photos. Our responsive website seamlessly integrates hand gestures, allowing users to express their preferences effortlessly through their laptop cameras. By harnessing the power of the Hantrack.js library, we've crafted an interactive environment where image interaction becomes not just a task but an engaging and intuitive journey.

## Key Features

### Responsive Design
The website offers a seamless experience across devices, adapting to different screen sizes. Whether on a laptop, tablet, or smartphone, the interface ensures a consistent and user-friendly layout.

### Hand Gesture Recognition
Utilizing the Hantrack.js library, the website recognizes various hand gestures captured through the laptop camera. Users can swipe, pinch, or wave to dynamically and intuitively rate photos.

### REST APIs from Unsplash
Integration with Unsplash's REST APIs provides a diverse collection of random, high-quality photos. Users can immerse themselves in a visually stunning journey, exploring and rating captivating images with simple hand movements.

## How It Works

1. **Camera Interaction:** Grant access to your laptop camera for gesture recognition.
2. **Hand Gesture Recognition:** Hantrack.js interprets real-time hand movements.
3. **API Integration:** Retrieve random Unsplash photos through REST APIs.
4. **Intuitive Rating:** Express preferences through hand gestures to rate displayed images.
